     * Polymorphism: In Java, polymorphism is a concept that allows objects to take
     * on multiple forms. This is done by overriding,
     * overloading, and method overloading.
     * There are two types of polymorphism:
     * 1. Compile-time polymorphism or know as early binding or static polymorphism
     * 2. Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic method dispatch)
     * 
     * 
     * -------------1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)----
     * Definition: This type of polymorphism is resolved at compile time. It is
     * achieved by method overloading or operator overloading (though operator
     * overloading is not supported in Java).
     * 
     * Key Points:
     * 
     * No inheritance needed for method overloading.
     * It involves same method name but different parameters (either different type,
     * number, or both).
     * The compiler can determine the correct method to call based on the method
     * signature at compile time.
     * 
     * 
     * ---------2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)----
     * Definition: This type of polymorphism is resolved at runtime. It is achieved
     * by method overriding in inheritance hierarchies.
     * 
     * Key Points:
     * 
     * Inheritance is required (you need a superclass and subclass).
     * The method in the subclass overrides a method in the superclass.
     * The JVM decides which method to call at runtime, based on the actual object
     * type (not the reference type).
     *
