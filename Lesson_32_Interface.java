     * An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can
     * contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods,
     * and nested types.
     * Interfaces cannot contain instance fields or constructors and cannot be
     * instantiated directly.
     * They are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java,
     * allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
     * Interfaces define a contract for what a class can do rather than how it does
     * it, ensuring that implementing classes provide specific behaviors defined by
     * the interface.
