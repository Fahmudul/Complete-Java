         * error** that can cause program crashes.
     * - It introduces **three types of errors**:
     * 1. **Compile-time errors** – Syntax mistakes detected by the compiler.
     * 2. **Logical errors** – The program runs but produces incorrect results.
     * 3. **Runtime errors** – Unexpected failures during execution.
     * - **Runtime errors example**: A program trying to open a deleted file
     * crashes.
     * - While minor applications can be restarted, **critical systems (medical
     * software, flight control, etc.) require proper error handling**.
     * - **Exceptions are runtime errors that need to be handled** to prevent
     * crashes.
     * - Preventive measures include **checking conditions before execution** (e.g.,
     * verifying file existence or ensuring a denominator is nonzero).
